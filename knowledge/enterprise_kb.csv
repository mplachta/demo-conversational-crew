Updating my crew in CrewAI Enterprise ,Updating your crew code in your CrewAI deployment,https://help.crewai.com/updating-my-crew-in-crewai,"<p>crewAI won't automatically pick up Github updates as default, so you will probably find yourself wanting to update you crew manually eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few different reasons for you to update your crew deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to update the code with a latest commit you pushed to Github</li>
<li>You want to reset the bearer token for security reasons</li>
<li>You want to update environment variables</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Just updating your crew for a latest commit</h3>
<p>All you have to do is to click on the ""Re-deploy"" button on your crew and that should trigger an update that you can tag along using a progress bar.</p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 04.05.03"" height=""331"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 670px;"" src=""https://45732688.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/45732688/Screenshot%202024-04-15%20at%2004.05.03.png"" width=""670"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<h3>2. Reset bearer token</h3>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to re-deploy while also reseting the bearer token protecting your app as you might have inadvertently leaked it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 04.05.47"" height=""331"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 670px;"" src=""https://45732688.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/45732688/Screenshot%202024-04-15%20at%2004.05.47.png"" width=""670"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<h3>3. Updating Environment Variables</h3>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to update your environment variables, maybe to change a model or another integration. If that is the case you want to go into the deployment page and update the values from there.</p>
<p>First access the deployment page by clicking the crew's name.</p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 04.06.31"" height=""333"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 670px;"" src=""https://45732688.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/45732688/Screenshot%202024-04-15%20at%2004.06.31.png"" width=""670"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<p>Now you can go into the Environment variable section and update values from there,a nd click on the update deployment button, this will also trigger a new deploy but this will only update the environment variables and not the code itself</p>

Using your crew's API in CrewAI Enterprise,How to turn your crew into an API within seconds and use it,https://help.crewai.com/using-your-crews-api-in-crewai,"<p>This article assumes you already <a href=""https://help.crewai.com/how-to-build-a-crew-for-crewai"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">build your crew</a> and <a href=""https://help.crewai.com/deploying-your-crew-to-crewai"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">deployed it on CrewAI</a><br>Assuming you have your crew live, you should have a base URL and a Bearer Token that got generated for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now your crew is basically an API and you call it using two main REST endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[GET] /inputs</code> - List all required inputs for the crew kickoff</li>
<li><code>[POST] /kickoff</code> - Starts a crew passing it's inputs and optional callbacks, you get back a <code>task_id</code></li>
<li>
<div><code>[GET] /status/{task_id}</code> - Using the <code>task_id</code> from the /kickoff request you can now pull this endpoint to get the task completion</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All endpoints are protected by a bearer token that is unique to your app, and that should be send using the authorization header.</p>
<h3>Inputs Endpoint</h3>
<p>The inputs endpoint is useful for you to programmatically learn the required inputs for your crew.</p>
<h3>Meta&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Allows you to pass in additional parameter</p>
<h3>Kickoff Endpoint</h3>
<p>The kickoff endpoint requires at least one attribute called <code>input</code> this input should be a dictionary with all the attributes the crew expects, anything you interpolated on the agents or tasks.</p>
<p>The kickoff endpoint also supports 3 extra arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>taskWebhookUrl</code> - Callback that will be executed upon the end of each task</li>
<li>
<div>
<div><code>stepWebhookUrl</code> <span style=""color: var(--primary-body-font-color); font-family: var(--primary-body-font-family); font-size: var(--primary-body-font-size); font-style: var(--primary-body-font-style); font-weight: var(--primary-body-font-weight);"">- Callback that will be executed upon each agent inner thought</span></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><code>crewWebhookUrl</code> - Callback that will be executed upon the end of the crew execution</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of an input for a Trip Planner crew:</p>
<div>
<pre>{<br>  ""inputs"": {<br>  &nbsp; ""budget"": ""1000 USD"",<br>  &nbsp; ""interests"": ""games, tech, ai, relaxing hikes, amazing food"",<br>  &nbsp; ""duration"": ""7 days"",<br>  &nbsp; ""age"": ""35""<br>  },<br>  ""meta"": ""...."",<br>  ""taskWebhookUrl"": ""https://..."",<br>  ""stepWebhookUrl"": ""https://..."",<br>  ""crewWebhookUrl"": ""https://...""<br>}</pre>
<h3>Status Endpoint</h3>
<p>The status endpoint allows you to tag along an execution by polling on this endpoint until you the get the full result of your crew.</p>

<p>To run this React component locally, you'll need to set up a React development environment and integrate this component into a React project. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Node.js:
<ul>
<li>Download and install Node.js from the official website: <a href=""https://nodejs.org/"">https://nodejs.org/</a></li>
<li>Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a new React project:
<ul>
<li>Open Command Prompt or PowerShell</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project</li>
<li>Run the following command to create a new React project:
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><code>npx create-react-app my-crew-app</code></div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>Change into the project directory:
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><code>cd my-crew-app</code></div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install necessary dependencies:
<ul>
<li>In your project directory, run:
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><code>npm install react-dom</code></div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create the CrewLead component:
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;move the downloaded file <code>CrewLead.jsx</code>&nbsp; into the <code>src</code> folder of your project,<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify your <code>App.js</code> to use the CrewLead component:
<ul>
<li>Open <code>src/App.js</code></li>
<li>Replace its contents with something like this:
<div>
<div>jsx</div>
<div>
<div>Copy</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><code>import React from 'react';<br>import CrewLead from './CrewLead';<br><br>function App() {<br>  return (<br>    &lt;div className=""App""&gt;<br>      &lt;CrewLead <br>        baseUrl=""YOUR_API_BASE_URL"" <br>        bearerToken=""YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN""<br>      /&gt;<br>    &lt;/div&gt;<br>  );<br>}<br><br>export default App;</code></div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>Replace <code>YOUR_API_BASE_URL</code> and <code>YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN</code> with the actual values for your API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start the development server:
<ul>
<li>In your project directory, run:
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><code>npm start</code></div>
</div>

How to use Annotations in crew.py,,https://help.crewai.com/how-to-use-annotations-in-crew.py,"<p>This guide explains how to use annotations to properly reference agents, tasks, and other components in the <code>crew.py</code>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Available Annotations</li>
<li>Usage Examples</li>
<li>YAML Configuration</li>
<li>Best Practices</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>Annotations in the framework are used to decorate classes and methods, providing metadata and functionality to various components of your crew. These annotations help in organizing and structuring your code, making it more readable and maintainable.</p>
<h4><strong>Available Annotations</strong></h4>
<p>The framework provides the following annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@CrewBase</code>: Used to decorate the main crew class.</li>
<li><code>@agent</code>: Decorates methods that define and return Agent objects.</li>
<li><code>@task</code>: Decorates methods that define and return Task objects.</li>
<li><code>@crew</code>: Decorates the method that creates and returns the Crew object.</li>
<li><code>@llm</code>: Decorates methods that initialize and return Language Model objects.</li>
<li><code>@tool</code>: Decorates methods that initialize and return Tool objects.</li>
<li><code>@callback</code>: (Not shown in the example, but available) Used for defining callback methods.</li>
<li><code>@output_json</code>: (Not shown in the example, but available) Used for methods that output JSON data.</li>
<li><code>@output_pydantic</code>: (Not shown in the example, but available) Used for methods that output Pydantic models.</li>
<li><code>@cache_handler</code>: (Not shown in the example, but available) Used for defining cache handling methods.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Usage Examples</strong></h4>
<p>Let's go through examples of how to use these annotations based on the provided <code>LinkedinProfileCrew</code> class:</p>
<h3>1. Crew Base Class</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>@CrewBase<br>class LinkedinProfileCrew():<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; """"""LinkedinProfile crew""""""<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'</code><code></code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@CrewBase</code> annotation is used to decorate the main crew class. This class typically contains configurations and methods for creating agents, tasks, and the crew itself.</p>
<h3>2. Tool Definition</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>@tool<br>def myLinkedInProfileTool(self):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return LinkedInProfileTool()</code><code></code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@tool</code> annotation is used to decorate methods that return tool objects. These tools can be used by agents to perform specific tasks.</p>
<h3>3. LLM Definition</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>@llm<br>def groq_llm(self):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; api_key = os.getenv('api_key')<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return ChatGroq(api_key=api_key, temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-&nbsp; &nbsp; 32768"")</code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@llm</code> annotation is used to decorate methods that initialize and return Language Model objects. These LLMs are used by agents for natural language processing tasks.</p>
<h3>4. Agent Definition</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><code>@agent<br>def researcher(self) -&gt; Agent:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return Agent(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config=self.agents_config['researcher']<br>    )</code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@agent</code> annotation is used to decorate methods that define and return Agent objects.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Task Definition</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>@task<br>def research_task(self) -&gt; Task:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return Task(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config=self.tasks_config['research_linkedin_task'],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; agent=self.researcher()<br>    )</code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@task</code> annotation is used to decorate methods that define and return Task objects. These methods specify the task configuration and the agent responsible for the task.</p>
<h3>6. Crew Creation</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>@crew<br>def crew(self) -&gt; Crew:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; """"""Creates the LinkedinProfile crew""""""<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return Crew(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; agents=self.agents, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tasks=self.tasks, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; process=Process.sequential,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; verbose=True<br>    )</code><code></code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <code>@crew</code> annotation is used to decorate the method that creates and returns the Crew object. This method assembles all the components (agents and tasks) into a functional crew.</p>
<h4><strong>YAML Configuration</strong></h4>
<p>The agent configurations are typically stored in a YAML file. Here's an example of how the <code>agents.yaml</code> file might look for the researcher agent:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><code>researcher:<br>&nbsp; role: &gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; LinkedIn Profile Senior Data Researcher<br>&nbsp; goal: &gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Uncover detailed LinkedIn profiles based on provided name {name} and domain {domain}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Generate a Dall-E image based on domain {domain}<br>&nbsp; backstory: &gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the most relevant&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LinkedIn profiles.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Known for your ability to navigate LinkedIn efficiently, you excel at&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gathering and presenting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; professional information clearly and concisely.<br>&nbsp; allow_delegation: False<br>&nbsp; verbose: True<br>&nbsp; llm: groq_llm<br>&nbsp; tools: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - myLinkedInProfileTool<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - mySerperDevTool<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - myDallETool</code></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This YAML configuration corresponds to the <code>researcher</code> agent defined in the <code>LinkedinProfileCrew</code> class. The configuration specifies the agent's role, goal, backstory, and other properties such as the LLM and tools it uses.</p>
<p>Note how the <code>llm</code> and <code>tools</code> in the YAML file correspond to the methods decorated with <code>@llm</code> and <code>@tool</code> in the Python class. This connection allows for a flexible and modular design where you can easily update agent configurations without changing the core code.</p>
<h4><strong>Best Practices</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consistent Naming</strong>: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your methods. For example, agent methods could be named after their roles (e.g., <code>researcher</code>, <code>reporting_analyst</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Environment Variables</strong>: Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Design your crew to be flexible by allowing easy addition or removal of agents and tasks.</li>
<li><strong>YAML-Code Correspondence</strong>: Ensure that the names and structures in your YAML files correspond correctly to the decorated methods in your Python code.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these guidelines and properly using annotations, you can create well-structured and maintainable crews using the Crew AI framework.</p>",FAQs,

How to enable Crew Studio for your account,,https://help.crewai.com/how-to-enable-crew-studio-for-your-account,"<p>Crew Studio is an amazing way to scaffold your Crews or even build some of them (for now the less complex ones) end-to-end with no-code. We use it every day! Crew Studio allows you to chat with our <strong>Crew Assistant</strong> and describe the problem that you are trying to solve with a Crew. It will generate the agents and tasks, select tools and suggest the inputs based on the provided information. After you generate the flow, you can download the code to connect it to custom APIs and later deploy to the platform!</p>
